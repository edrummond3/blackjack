Blackjack game written in Python and using Beeware toolkit for UI elements.
There are two versions of the game: App and Console

To run the App version, run the installer found in the windows folder.  This will install the executable and place it in the Start menu.
To run the Console version, use any IDE to run game.py.  Make sure statistics.txt is in the same folder.

The App version is played using the click buttons, while the Console version is played by typing key prompts.  Only the Console version saves game statistics.
